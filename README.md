# Possible-GCD-numbers-check
Find if positive integers a and b for given numbers l and r so that: 1) The sum a+b lies between l and r inclusive. 2) The greatest common divisor(GCD) of a and b isn't 1. are possible or not? If no such numbers exist, print "No" else print "Yes". For example, gcd(6, 9)=3, gcd(8, 9)=1, gcd(4, 2)=2.
